**Adds:**

### Overscoring
Overscoring is there to make sure that you dont get _too_ powerful, scoring too high on the boss blind sends you forward extra Antes

### Metaprogression
Metaprogression gives you generous rewards but also cranks up the difficulty over the course of multiple runs, making each run build upon the last.

### Tauic Jokers
Ever thought that the normal vanilla jokers weren't cool enough? Well now you can convert them into powerful versions of themselves, called Tauic variants.

### Unsurpassed and Supercursed Jokers
Hefty upsides with hefty downsides, everything has a price. Now to figure out a way to lock those troublesome downsides away...

### The Ever Evolving Quantum Particle
An ever changing particle, always complimenting the buff given by your deck.

### Superplanets
Rare but powerful, superplanet cards encompass entire galaxies, and similarly to their large area, they bless you with hand levels untold.
